/* important when you start this page plaese wait for nearly 3-4 min*/


so basically here are three pages 
1) Home
	it is page where we search all superheroes
	we need to type it's name auto suggestion come and then we have to click search
	we have two option we can add to favourite or or view it directly

2) Superheropage
  here we view the page here we use localstorage

 3)
 	Favourite page
 	all favourite where we add and remove 
 I used jquery ,bootstrap
*the basic idea is whenever i need to share data b/w two pages before going there i store into localstorage
for ex i have to go to superhero page on click button then first i run async function to fetch data and store into localStorage on succes i will go to next page
